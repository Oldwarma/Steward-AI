# 🧠 Steward AI
 
**Steward AI** is a multimodal AI-powered personal copilot designed to help users
**think, analyze, and create** through natural conversation.

It integrates large language models, speech interaction, knowledge retrieval,
trend analysis, and lightweight agent capabilities into a single, extensible
system.

At its core, Steward AI is not just a chatbot — it is a **personal AI steward**
that helps manage information, ideas, and decisions.

## ✨ Meet Your AI Steward: Elliot

**Elliot** is the conversational interface of Steward AI.

It is designed to be:
- Thoughtful, structured, and concise
- Focused on reasoning and usability
- Capable of turning vague ideas into actionable outputs

You interact with Elliot through text or voice, just like talking to a personal
assistant who understands context and intent.

## 🌍 项目简介（中文）

**Steward AI（个人智能管家）** 是一个多模态 AI 项目，旨在通过自然对话，
帮助用户完成 **信息理解、趋势分析和创意产出**。

与传统聊天机器人不同，Steward AI 更关注 **“可用结果”**：
它不仅能回答问题，还能基于知识库进行检索、分析外部热点信息，
并将模糊的想法转化为结构化、可执行的产出，例如产品构想或原型描述。

该项目主要用于探索 **AI 在真实个人工作流中的应用方式**，
而不仅仅是模型能力的展示。
